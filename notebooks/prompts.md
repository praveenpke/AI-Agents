I'm building "MovieBuddy" — a step-by-step LangGraph learning project in /Users/praveen/Documents/AI_Projects/AI-Agents/movie_buddy.ipynb      
                                                                                                                                                 
  You are my guide. I type the code myself, run it, and ask doubts. You explain each concept, then give me code to type.                       

  The project covers ALL 14 LangGraph topics from my Notion page "LangGraph Detailed" (ID: 2ff60601-d166-8157-87a2-e3fc58c22279). Read it to see
  the full topic list.

  COMPLETED:
  - Step 1: Simple Graph (State, Nodes, Edges, conditional routing) ✅
  - Step 2: Add LLM (MessagesState, ChatOpenAI, add_messages reducer) ✅

  NEXT UP:
  - Step 3: Add Tools (@tool, ToolNode, tools_condition, Router pattern)

  REMAINING after Step 3:
  - Step 4: ReAct Loop (tools → assistant loop)
  - Step 5: Memory (MemorySaver, thread_id)
  - Step 6: Custom State (Pydantic, reducers, input/output schemas)
  - Step 7: Long Conversations (trim, summarize)
  - Step 8: Persistent Storage (SQLite checkpointer)
  - Step 9: Streaming
  - Step 10: Human-in-the-Loop (breakpoints)
  - Step 11: Time Travel (history, fork)
  - Step 12: Parallel + Sub-graphs + Map-Reduce
  - Step 13: Long-Term Memory (InMemoryStore)
  - Step 14: Deployment (concept)

  Read my notebook first to see what I've built so far, then continue from Step 3.
